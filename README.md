This application offers three Python scripts which execute ETL processes for an American Express credit card owner dataset.

transform_load.py will clean and transform csv files and insert into their respective tables

extract_train.py will query data from all records and then train an XGBClassifier model using the query results

update_customer_info.py allows a user to alter records of any table using primary key lookup

amex.py allow a user to enter an existing primary key for the customers table, and predict if the record associated with the key is a risk for credit card default
